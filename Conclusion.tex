In this report, we introduce some basic concepts of the quantum information theory.
That is, the difference between a qubit and a classical bit as well as the representation of a quantum system.
Besides, we also show the definition of quantum entropy and give four properties of this definition, including positivity, minimum value, maximum value, and the concavity, which are similar to the properties of classical Shannon entropy.
However, there also exists some different properties in the quantum world.
That is, the condition quantum entropy can be negative, and this is due to the physical entanglement phenomenon such that the joint system can be more certain than the marginal system.
In the end of this report, we give some inequalities to bound the amount of information can be carried in a quantum system.
That is, the quantum information does not compress the classical information.
