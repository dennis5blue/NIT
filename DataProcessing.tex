\subsection{Data Processing}
The quantum data processing inequality is similar in spirit to the classical data processing inequality.
Recall the classical data processing case, if $X_1-X_2-X_3$ forms a Markov chain, the inequality $I(X_1;X_2) \geq I(X_1;X_3)$ holds.
Now we introduce a quantum case.

Suppose that Alice and Bob share some pure bipartite state $|\phi \rangle ^{AB}$.
The coherent information $I(A\rangle B)_{\phi}$ quantifies the quantum correlations present in the state.
Bob then processes his system B according to some mappings $N_1^{B\to B_1}$ to produce some quantum system $B_1$ and let $\rho ^{AB_1}$ denote the resulting state.
A condition similar to the Markov condition holds for the quantum case.
The map $N_1^{B\to B_1}$ acts only on one of Bob's systems which means that it does not act in any way on Alice's system.
The quantum data processing inequality states that each step of quantum data processing reduces quantum correlations, in the sense that
\begin{align}
I(A \rangle B)_{\phi} \geq I(A \rangle B_1)_{\rho}.
\end{align}
The inequality can be proved in Section~\ref{sec:pfDataProcess}.
