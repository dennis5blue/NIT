In this report, we will introduce the idea of Quantum information theory and try to point out the difference between the classical and the quantum world.
First of all, we will give some background knowledge, which might be fundamental to describe a quantum system.
This part includes ``what is a quantum bit'' and ``how to represent a quantum system.''
After that, we will explain the definition of quantum entropy together with some of its basic properties.
Note that some properties are similar to the classical Shannon entropy; however, some properties are very different.
Therefore, we will also show the difference and give some intuitive explanations.
At the end of our report, we will show a very important theorem in the quantum world, which is used to calculate the amount of information that can be carried in a quantum system.
